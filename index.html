	<h3><p>
		My name is Patrick Hernandez and I am 20 years old. My hobbies include playing guitar, soccer and computer programming. A little over 3 years ago, after becoming critically sick I had to have a major organ removed in order to save my life. Although this was a challenging time, I am living proof that hard work and persistence can go a long way. Now that I have made a full recovery my enthusiasm for programming has not changed and I am ready for any opportunity that the future has in store. I am dedicated, eager to learn and don't shy away from new challenges.
